# Mental Math

## Overview
Quick mental calculation skills are essential for trading and quantitative roles. Speed and accuracy are both important.

## Key Skills

### Basic Operations
- [ ] Addition and subtraction
- [ ] Multiplication (single and multi-digit)
- [ ] Division and remainders
- [ ] Percentages
- [ ] Fractions and decimals

### Advanced Techniques
- [ ] Squaring numbers
- [ ] Square roots (estimation)
- [ ] Powers and exponents
- [ ] Logarithms (estimation)
- [ ] Scientific notation

## Quick Tricks

### Multiplication
- **By 11**: 43 × 11 = 4[4+3]3 = 473
- **By 5**: Multiply by 10, divide by 2
- **By 9**: Multiply by 10, subtract original
- **Squares near 50**: 47² = (50-3)² = 2500 - 300 + 9 = 2209

### Division
- **By 5**: Multiply by 2, divide by 10
- **By 25**: Multiply by 4, divide by 100

### Percentages
- **15% tip**: 10% + half of 10%
- **Calculate % of %**: 16% of 25 = 4
- **Reverse**: What % is X of Y? = (X/Y) × 100

### Estimation
- **Round strategically**: 47 × 32 ≈ 50 × 30 = 1500
- **Factor and simplify**: 24 × 15 = 24 × 10 + 24 × 5
- **Use benchmarks**: Compare to powers of 10
