# Statistics

## Overview
Statistical methods are essential for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and making inferences from data in quantitative roles.

## Key Concepts
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
- Sampling and estimation
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- p-values and significance levels
- Type I and Type II errors
- Regression analysis
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Central limit theorem applications

## Common Topics

### Descriptive Statistics
- [ ] Measures of central tendency
- [ ] Measures of dispersion
- [ ] Skewness and kurtosis
- [ ] Percentiles and quartiles
- [ ] Correlation vs causation

### Inferential Statistics
- [ ] Point estimation
- [ ] Interval estimation
- [ ] Confidence intervals
- [ ] Hypothesis testing (t-test, z-test, chi-square)
- [ ] ANOVA
- [ ] Power analysis

### Regression and Modeling
- [ ] Linear regression
- [ ] Multiple regression
- [ ] Assumptions of regression
- [ ] R-squared interpretation
- [ ] Residual analysis

## Example Problems

### Easy
1. Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset
2. What is the 95% confidence interval for a sample mean?
3. Interpret correlation coefficient

### Medium
1. A/B test: how to determine if difference is significant?
2. Explain Type I vs Type II errors with examples
3. When to use t-test vs z-test?
4. How does sample size affect confidence interval?

### Hard
1. Design an experiment to test effectiveness of a new trading strategy
2. Explain multiple testing problem and correction methods
3. How would you detect if two distributions are different?
4. Regression to the mean in portfolio performance

## Tips for Interviews
- Know when to use each statistical test
- Understand assumptions behind methods
- Be able to explain concepts simply
- Connect statistics to real-world applications
- Know common pitfalls (correlation ≠ causation, survivorship bias)
