# Probability

## Overview
Probability theory forms the foundation of quantitative finance, risk management, and statistical modeling.

## Key Concepts
- Basic probability rules
- Conditional probability
- Bayes' theorem
- Independence
- Random variables
- Expected value and variance
- Common distributions (Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Poisson)
- Law of large numbers
- Central limit theorem

## Example Problems

### Easy
1. What is the probability of getting at least one head in 3 coin flips?
2. Two dice are rolled. What is the probability their sum is 7?
3. What is the expected value of a single die roll?

### Medium
1. You draw cards from a deck without replacement. What is the probability of drawing 2 aces in 3 draws?
2. Given two people are born on different days, what is the probability they are born in the same month?
3. Expected number of coin flips to get first head?

### Hard
1. Calculate expected number of dice rolls to see all 6 faces (coupon collector)
2. You play a game where you win your bet with 60% probability and lose it with 40%. What is the optimal betting strategy?
3. Two points are chosen randomly on a line of length 1. What is the expected distance between them?

## Tips for Interviews
- Draw diagrams and probability trees
- Check your answer makes intuitive sense
- Consider edge cases
- Use conditional probability systematically
- Verify probabilities sum to 1
- State your assumptions clearly
