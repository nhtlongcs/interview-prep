# Linked Lists

## Overview
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes with pointers to the next (and sometimes previous) node.

## Key Concepts
- Node structure and pointers
- Traversal techniques
- Two-pointer technique (fast & slow pointers)
- Dummy head nodes
- Reversing linked lists
- Cycle detection

## Common Problems

### Easy
- [ ] Reverse Linked List
- [ ] Merge Two Sorted Lists
- [ ] Linked List Cycle
- [ ] Remove Linked List Elements
- [ ] Middle of the Linked List
- [ ] Palindrome Linked List

### Medium
- [ ] Add Two Numbers
- [ ] Remove Nth Node From End of List
- [ ] Reorder List
- [ ] Swap Nodes in Pairs
- [ ] Rotate List
- [ ] Linked List Cycle II

### Hard
- [ ] Merge k Sorted Lists
- [ ] Reverse Nodes in k-Group
- [ ] Copy List with Random Pointer

## Time & Space Complexity Patterns
- Traversal: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Fast & slow pointer: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Recursive solutions: O(n) time, O(n) space (call stack)

## Tips
- Use dummy head node to simplify edge cases
- Fast & slow pointers for cycle detection and finding middle
- Draw diagrams to visualize pointer changes
- Be careful with null pointer checks
- Consider recursive vs iterative approaches
