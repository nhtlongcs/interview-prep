# Arrays

## Overview
Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements in contiguous memory locations. Understanding array manipulation is crucial for technical interviews.

## Key Concepts
- Array traversal and iteration
- Two-pointer technique
- Sliding window
- Prefix sums
- Sorting and searching
- In-place modifications

## Common Problems

### Easy
- [ ] Two Sum
- [ ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- [ ] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- [ ] Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)
- [ ] Merge Sorted Array
- [ ] Contains Duplicate

### Medium
- [ ] Three Sum
- [ ] Container With Most Water
- [ ] Product of Array Except Self
- [ ] Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
- [ ] Rotate Array
- [ ] Subarray Sum Equals K

### Hard
- [ ] Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- [ ] Trapping Rain Water
- [ ] First Missing Positive
- [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Time & Space Complexity Patterns
- Linear scan: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Two pointer: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Sorting-based: O(n log n) time, O(1) or O(n) space
- Hash map: O(n) time, O(n) space

## Tips
- Always consider edge cases: empty array, single element, duplicates
- Two-pointer technique works well for sorted arrays
- Consider if sorting would help simplify the problem
- Hash maps can trade space for time complexity
