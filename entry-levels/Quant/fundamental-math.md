Combinatorics & Probability

I highly recommend solving problems on Alcumus, an interactive platform with an adaptive curriculum that adjusts to your learning pace.

Instructions
Register an account.
Go to Alcumus, then open Settings.
Set Problem Difficulty to "Insanely Hard".
For Advance Only on Mastery, select "Yes".
Go to Play, select Change Focus (top right), and choose Number Theory.
Try to master all topics.
Mastery is achieved when the progress bar turns blue!
Below is an example of a mastered topic:

Just change to the focus to Counting & Probability in Alcumus.
