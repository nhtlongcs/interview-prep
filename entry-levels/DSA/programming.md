TO learn this efficiently, I recommend you think about the problems and try to solve them on your own first. Then, MUST watch the solution video and read the solution article to understand the methods and techniques to solve the problems. **Dont need to panic if you cant solve the problems on your own, just try your best. The most important part is to understand the solution and the techniques used in the solution. The course group the problems by topics, so you can learn the techniques by topics.**
