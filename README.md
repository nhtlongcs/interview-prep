### Ultimate Interview Preparation Guide

Create a cheatsheet yourself, based on your own experience and the resources you find useful. Sort them by topics & difficulty, and keep updating it as you learn more.

The reason why you need your own cheatsheet is that human brain remembers things better when you force it to organize information in your own way. So, writing your own notes is a great way to reinforce learning. Don't use someone else's consolidated notes as your main resource. Try to understand and summarize things in your own words.

Keep you in pressure to study by setting deadlines for yourself. Use a calendar or task management app to schedule regular study sessions.
