## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose a Topic**: Navigate to the relevant directory based on your interview focus
2. **Review Problems**: Each directory contains problem statements and solutions
3. **Practice**: Implement solutions before looking at the provided answers
4. **Track Progress**: Use the checkboxes in README files to track completed problems

## 📝 Problem Format

Each problem directory typically contains:
- `README.md` - Problem statement and description
- `solution.*` - Solution in various programming languages
- `test.*` - Test cases (where applicable)
- `notes.md` - Additional notes, complexity analysis, and tips

## 🎯 Recommended Study Path

### For Software Engineering Interviews:
1. Start with fundamental data structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
2. Progress to Trees and Graphs
3. Master Dynamic Programming
4. Practice problem-solving patterns across topics

### For Quantitative/Trading Interviews:
1. Build strong foundation in Probability and Statistics
2. Practice Mental Math daily
3. Work through Brainteasers and Math Puzzles
4. Study Market Making and Option Pricing concepts

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Consistency**: Practice daily, even if just one problem
- **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding patterns and approaches
- **Time Yourself**: Practice under timed conditions
- **Explain Your Thinking**: Practice explaining your approach out loud
- **Review Regularly**: Revisit problems you found challenging
